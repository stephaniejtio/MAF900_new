#The Aim of This Repository
This project replicates the empirical analysis from Fama and MacBeth's 1973 paper, Risk, Return, and Equilibrium: Empirical Tests. The replication focuses on US stock data from January 1926 to December 2023 and reproduces the results in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the original paper.
The project is completed as part of the MAF900 unit for T2 2024. The assignment includes data collection, empirical analysis, and report creation using R / RStudio.

#Background of Fama and MacBeth
The 1973 paper by Eugene F. Fama and James D. MacBeth, "Risk, Return, and Equilibrium: Empirical Tests," is pivotal in finance, introducing rigorous empirical methods to test the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Their innovative approach, which combined time series and cross-sectional regression analyses to assess the relationship between asset returns and market risk, has significantly influenced asset pricing theory and led to the development of multi-factor models.
