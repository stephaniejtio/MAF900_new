Discussion between Kristina and Stephanie

20240925 by kristina
I saw you used quantile to divide the portfolio, which I am still worrying. 
From the paper, the method they used can be found in page 615, B. Details. 
As in our data, after deleting the n/a obs, we have a total of 776 obs. 
As a result, 776 is an even number, so, we use 776/20 = 38.8. 
For the middle 18 portfolios, we use int(776/20), which is 38. 
For the first and last one, we use int(776/20)+(1/2)(776-20*int(776/20)), which is equal to 46. 
To sum up, the number of stocks in 1st and 20th portfolio is equal to 46, for 2nd to 19th, they are 38. 

And from row 212, i can see you used the paper method. However, after checking the number of stocks in the portfolio, it seems to be inaccurate. 
For 1st portfolio, it only has 39 stocks, for the second one, also 39 stocks. 
We might need to check the codes again. 



Stephanie
Noted. I'll go through the codes again. 
I provide two different approaches on the R code, the first one is the quantile method, 
and the second one is based on the paper page 615 B (Details)

Kristina (20240929)
Let us use the paper method to define the portofolio from 1926 to 1929. 
Please see my work from row 218 to row 231 about the portfolio definition and allocation. If no issues, would you mind deleting the codes of another method to ensure our job is clear to Dr Saikat. 

Kristina (20240930)
Hi Stephanie, here are some questions i would like to discuss with you, please pull the new code file, and check it. 
1. Please note, i already changed the file to collect raw stock return and market return instead of excess return, because the paper is using the raw return to do. Thus, the variable names have been changed to raw_ret and raw_mkt (Note, i already modified the variable names in your part, so you dont need to do it again). 
2. I add some new libraries. 
3. Can you let me know the meaning and reason why you do from row 154 to row 174, row 191 to row 193, i am wondering the logic behind these codes. Do you think it is necessary to do that?
4. Please check my new work after yours, i begin to construct the sample of the initial estimation period and create the first four variables in table 2 in page 620, and merge all into a file named table2. You can do it by following, but please remember to merge all results in table2. 
5. When i run the regression and check the results, i found my output is signficantly different from the paper's, which made me feel confused. Do you mind helping me figure out the reason and express your opinion on it? Thanks. 
6. You can continue to do your part, thank you!


Stephanie (223935051)
Hi Kristina 
The line 154 to 174 is to divide the stocks into the 20 portfolios
because I tried using the normal approach to allocate the stocks into the portfolio (without the quantile), but ot seems the stocks are all allocated in the same portfolio (it is not
distributed evenly into the 20 portfolios) 
I assume it is because of the value of beta that is clustered closely 

   Min.   1st Qu.   Median     Mean   3rd Qu.    Max. 
-9.5518   0.5976    0.9359    0.9774  1.2848    6.0050 

As a result, stocks ended up being allocated to one single portfolio, because there wasn't enough variation in the 
beta values to spread them out across multiple portfolios with this method.

line 168 to 174 is optional, it is for a check-point, and we can just change to comment after using the codes


Kristina (20241001)
Hey Stephanie, thanks for your answer. 
1. Would you mind rechecking your calculation of table 2 row5 (standard deviation of the portfolio residuals), which is not correct. Your result is the average value of average return. In my understanding, you need to use the file named average_by_portfolio created by me, to run the regression following the model (8) in page 616, and then calculate the sd of residuals. Let me know if you have any questions. 
2. Your calculation of row 6 also needs to be considered again. You need to calculate the security level average standard deviations of residuals. 
3. Can you go through my previous work again? And then try to understand the meaning of those statistics following by page 617 C. Some observations on the approach, and then redo your part. Thanks. 
4. I modify something in R.codes, please pull it again and then redo. 


Stephanie (223935051)
1. Hey Kristina, thank you for the comments, I have gone through your work again, and re-code my work based on the paper's formula
2. I have re-calculated the standard deviation of the portfolio residuals s(ϵ^p)
and the average standard deviation of individual security residuals within the portfolio s̅_p,t-1(ε_i)

3. I also did the last part which is the ratio that compares the portfolio’s residual risk (idiosyncratic risk at the portfolio level) 
to the average residual risk of the securities within the portfolio. (s(ε_p) / s̅_p,t-1(ε_i))
4. I have push the code as well to git, please pull the code again for the recent ones
5. let me know if you have any questions or any thoughts, thank you! (I put my comment in the r script as well for further details)

Kristina(20241002)
For something new:
1. I follow Saikat's codes to create new mkt return using fisher index. 
2. I push Saikat's codes to our github, you can refer and modify your part if necessary. 
3. I just found table2 is for period between 1934-1938, not 1930-1934. We need to do some modifications to our codes. I alread fixed my part, can you go throught and fix your part?  
4. For reference, i normally give the suffix of 1 for the results in the portfolio formation period, 2 for the results in initial estimation period, 3 for the results in testing period. 

Stephanie (223935051)
1. Hey Kristina, I have checked Dr. Saikat's code that you uploaded (mkt return by using the fisher index) 
2. I did go through the code to check and align with the new approach, and I have updated accordingly 
3. I also did change the Table 2 construction based on the sample period 1934 - 1938, and I assigned with several new variable names
(so it is clearer and to avoid using the previous dataframe/data)

Kristina (20241003)
Hi Stephanie.
1. I changed the beta calculation in table 2 (row1, row2), as i suddenly found that beta should be updated year by year, not just used the period of 1930-1934, but also 1930-1935, 1930-1936 and so on. Please see my new work, and changed yours. 
2. For the variable row 6 you calculated, note, the mark is t-1, which means you need to use the one period before testing period (what i explained in 1.), please go through the slides Dr Saikat showed in the class (Remember? He onced explained to us how we use the beta in the testing period) and page617 c. in the paper. 
3. I am not pretty sure that i did it correctly, please go through the paper and let me know if you have any new thoughts. 

Stephanie (223935051)
Hi Kristina
1. I have updated my code (calculation for table 2) based on the beta which should be updated year by year. 
2. Row 6, I have updated my code so it is t-1 (calculate idsr (avg standard deviation of residuals) for each security in t-1)
3. A suggestion, instead of creating three different functions for each period. we can use one function 
function(end_date, permno_by_portfolio)
create a new variable for each period and refer back to the function with each of period (Please refer to the code I updated) 
Please let me know if you have any inputs :) 


Stephanie (223935051)
Hi Kristina, I have created a function to automate and repeat the calculation of:
1. Function to calculate portfolio betas and residuals
2. Function to assign securities to portfolios based on beta rankings, portfolio allocation 
3. Function to calculate portfolio returns
4. Function to calculate betas for the given period, assign securities to portfolios based on beta, 
calculate portfolio returns for the next period, save the results in each of the periods 
5. the list of periods can be adjusted and modified based on the required periods
6. Feel free to give any inputs and let me know if you have any questions 
Thank you!

kristina (20241008)
Hey Stepahnie. Please see below: 
1. I deleted and modified some codes which i found it not to be very necessary. You can go through and see if anything you would like to keep. 
2. Our logic now become, first use 1926-1929, 1930-1934, 1935-1938 as a example to calculate the statistics. Then, creating a function to run other periods. And check if the function results are same as that we got from the begining example. 
3. Now, i found, after comparing the dataset of table 2 and results, they are consistent.
4. We can list all other periods until 2022 to get the results. 
5. And now i try to discipline our codes' style. When we write code, we provide an explanation for the code (which we do very well). Explanations can be written in lowercase (this saves time). Let us keep them as consistency. I already modified your part and my part up to now, pls check and use the same style in the future. 
6. I did new things to use all periods to calculate the statistics in Table 2 (dataset is results). And i output a xlsx file called TABLE 2. Please have a look. If you have a better method, please modify. 
7. Now, you can work on Table 3 Panel A. If you have any questions when you do this, let me know, we can orgaize a call. My plan is to finish all panels in Table 2 by Saturday night, and we will do Table 4 during sunday. Next week, begin to correct errors we made and write the report. 



Stephanie (223935051)
Hi Kristina, thank you for the updates
1. I have reviewed the code you updated and will continue the code to replicate Table 3 (I have updated and pushed the code to git)
2. Table 3: Summary results for the regression based on the formula 
3. I start on Panel A period 1935 - 1968 with the first 3 gama(s)
4. The approach is by calculating beta p, which is the slope of beta and create function, which is the function to calculate Fama-MacBeth coefficients
5. Calculate the time-series regression of portfolio returns (Rp) on factors (beta_p, beta_p^2, residual risk)
6. Calculate the cross-sectional averages, and the function will return gama1, gama2, and gama3 based on the paper 
Please let me know if you have any questions and feel free to give any input.
7. I have noted your suggestion to explain the codes with the comments on R studio, I think so far our codes are well commented on and explained,
my suggestion, we need (mandatory) provide explanations and comments on major parts of the codes, additionally we should review top to bottom to finalize and ensuring consistency of our code script before the submission 
8. We can have synced up calls during the weekend 
(I have free up my weekend to focus on assignments so, I'm free on Saturday and Sunday at any time), let me know what time suits the best for you)
Thank you! 


Kristina (20241011)
Hey,
1. I saw that u used avg_return to calculate the beta p. But, i think it is not accurate. From the page 617-618, the author explains the meaning of Table 3's statistics. In 618, the last paragraph, he said now using Beta p to simplify the notation. So, we probably still need to follow the equation 10. Using the rolling method we just applied for Table 2 to assign beta value to each portfolio in each month of each year. 
2. I modified our codes to meet the data requirement in page 617, this will help us generate the Table 1. see row 84 to row 102. 
3. I guess we need to only use the data meeting requirement to form portfolio, calculate statistics, etc. I already mondified both your and my parts. You can go through all codes and the functions to understand it. 
3. And When you do table 3, you need to follow the data requirement, too. 



Stephanie (223935051)
1. Updated table 3 for the first period (gamma 0 and gamma1)
2. with avg_ret to calculate Intercept and Beta_p

1. I have created a function for Table 3, based on the discussion call we had.
2. Please kindly check, feel free to modify and let me know if you have any comments 
thank you :)


Kristina(20241015)
Hey,
1. I already checked your codes, but some errors made, so i changed and added many codes. Now, i already created table 3 panel a. 
2. Please have a look very carefully, and then start from Panel B. 
3. My logic is to create two functions when we do table 3, you can mock my work to do panel B. 
4. Can you delete those useless files from github, thanks. 

Stephanie (223935051)
hey Kristina
1. I have create the function for Table 3 Panel B
please kindly review and let me know if you have any inputs 
Thank you
