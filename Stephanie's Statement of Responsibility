Both of the members (Stephanie and Kristina) responsible for
- README.md file and Report document, code consistency and format, Git repo

Responsibility in R Studio code:
1. Calculate Betas for each stock carefully to align with Fama's approach 
2. Ranking the Betas to 20 portfolios (Portfolio Formation) and calculate the size for each portfolio
3. Form regression calculates standard deviation of residuals for each portfolio
4. Statistics calculation of s(ε^p), sˉp,t−1(ε^i), s(ε^p)/sˉp,t−1(ε^i) for Table 2
5. Create Function to automate and calculate for other and the rest of the periods 
with each portfolio, estimation, and testing periods 
6. Create function to collect all betas values in Table 2 until beta_0
7. Collect FF 3 factor data and Create Pre-requisites Function Gamma Table 3 
8. Creating function to create Panel B and Panel C for Table 3
