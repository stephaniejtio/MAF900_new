In the file named a3_code.R, we both specify each member's input, e.g., start by xxx, finish by xxx, improved by xxx. 

For details of mine:
Both members are responsible README.md and Report.doc. 

Additionally, I am responsible for the following parts: 
1. Data collection 
2. Data filtering based on data requirements
3. Statistics calculation of β_(p,t-1), s(β_{p,t-1}), r(Rp, Rm)^2, s(Rp) of period 1(1926-1938) mocking in table 2
4. Creating a function to do the rest of periods. 
5. Defining all periods from table 1, creating table 1 and table 2. 
6. Creating a function to collect all beta values got in table 2 until beta_0. 
7. Creating a function to collect all beta values got in table 2 from beta_1 to beta_3, average portfolio return, standard deviation of residuals and organize the betas into a exercisable table for the regression of table3, defining periods of the function. 
8. Creating a function to create panel a and panel d in table 3.
