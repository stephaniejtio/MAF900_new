Kristina's individual statement on the responsibility for this project. 

Both of the members (Stephanie and Kristina) are responsible for:
- README.md file (instructions and details of the project)
- Report document (analysis to compare findings of the replication with the original paper of Fama Macbeth)
- Code consistency and formatting (ensuring readability) 
- Git repo (our main project repository)  

Additionally, I am responsible for the following parts: 
1. Data collection 
2. Data filtering based on data requirements
3. Statistics calculation of β_(p,t-1), s(β_{p,t-1}), r(Rp, Rm)^2, s(Rp) of period 1(1926-1938) mocking in table 2
4. Create a Function to automate and calculate for other and the rest of the periods based on Fama's paper
with each portfolio, estimation, and testing periods  
5. Defining all periods from Table 1, creating table 1 and table 2. 
6. Creating a function to collect all beta values got in Table 2 until beta_0. 
7. Creating a function to collect all beta values got in table 2 from beta_1 to beta_3, average portfolio return, standard deviation of residuals and organize the betas into an exercisable table for the regression of table 3, defining periods of the function. 
8. Create a function to create panel a and panel d in Table 3. 
9. Integrating all panels together to create table 3. 
10. Calculating statistics in Table 4 and output. 

My communication and collaboration with my team member (Stephanie) are through:
- Microsoft Teams (meetings and calls for discussion)
- WhatsApp (to update daily every time we commit and push to Git)
- Google Docs (collaborate on the report)
- Discussion document (available on Git, emphasizing our key points of discussion and specifying what we have updated)
- Git Repository (commit, push, and pull daily)
