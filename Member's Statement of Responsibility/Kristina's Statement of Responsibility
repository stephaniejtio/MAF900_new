Kristina's individual statement on the responsibility for this project. 

In the file named a3_code.R, we both specify each member's input, e.g., start by xxx, finish by xxx, improved by xxx. 

For details of mine:
Both members are responsible README.md and Report.doc. 

Additionally, I am responsible for the following parts: 
1. Data collection 
2. Data filtering based on data requirements
3. Statistics calculation of β_(p,t-1), s(β_{p,t-1}), r(Rp, Rm)^2, s(Rp) of period 1(1926-1938) mocking in table 2
4. Create a Function to automate and calculate for other and the rest of the periods based on Fama's paper
with each portfolio, estimation, and testing periods  
5. Defining all periods from Table 1, creating table 1 and table 2. 
6. Creating a function to collect all beta values got in Table 2 until beta_0. 
7. Creating a function to collect all beta values got in table 2 from beta_1 to beta_3, average portfolio return, standard deviation of residuals and organize the betas into an exercisable table for the regression of table 3, defining periods of the function. 
8. Create a function to create panel a and panel d in Table 3. 
9. Integrating all panels together to create table 3. 
10. Calculating statistics in Table 4 and output.
